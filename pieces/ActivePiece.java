	/*General "wallkicking" algorithm:

	1) Copy the active piece (twice) so we can set it back later if the rotation fails.
	
	2) Clear the active piece to get it out of the way.
	
	3) Rotate the copy.
	
	4) Add all out-of-bounds collisions to a list. An out-of-bounds collision consists
		of the point at which the rotated copy is out of bounds, and a collision type, which
		signifies which side of the board it happened on.
		
	5) Add all piece collisions to a list. Again, a piece collision consists of a
		point where the collision happened, and a collision type. The collision type
		specifies which side of the ORIGINAL piece the collision happened on.
	
	6) Now, handle four cases.
		I) The piece rotated out of bounds and is NOT colliding with another piece.
			In this case, try moving the piece back in bounds. If there's no collision,
			then the rotation is successful, and we jump to 7.
		II) The piece is out of bounds and colliding with another piece. In most cases,
			this means the piece can't be rotated (imagine a piece wedged between another
			piece and a wall), but not always.		
		III) The rotated piece induces collisions on two sides of the ORIGINAL piece.
			In this case, the rotation isn't possible because we can't kick the piece 
			without causing another collision.
		IV) The rotated piece is colliding with at least another subsquare. In this case,
			we try to move the piece back out of the collision (i.e., "kick" it),
			and make sure that doesn't cause another collision or an out-of-bounds.
			
	7) If the rotation was successful, set the rotated piece on the board and return
		true.
	
	8) If the rotation was not successful, set the original piece back on the board
		and return false.
